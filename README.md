# Graduate-Admission-Predictor

## What is this project about?

Students all across the world go through a phase where they have to make a decision whether they wish to study further in order to gain in-dept knowledge about the stuff in their field or whether they start working.

This is still a black-box area in the minds of students and they are confused as to which decision to take, prompting them to go to career coaches, study-abroad educational services and consultancy firms. 

These consultancy firms hire anywhere between $80-$250 per hour. 

We developed a free-of-cost, open source software which addresses if we will be able to make it to the graduate admissions based on several features such as GRE,TOEFL,LOR,SOP,Work Ex and many other such features.

Additionally we also use Explainable AI to provide personalised feedback to students as to which features in their profile acted as a deterrent.
